*Cooked up by [Alex Kern](https://kern.io) & [Neeraj Baid](http://neeraj.io) while eating Sliver @ UC Berkeley.*

Using [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org), FilePizza eliminates the initial upload step required by other web-based file sharing services. Because data is never stored in an intermediary server, the transfer is fast, private, and secure.

A hosted instance of FilePizza is available at [file.pizza](https://file.pizza).

## FAQ

**How are my files sent?** Your files are sent directly from your browser to the downloader's browser. They never pass through our servers. FilePizza uses WebRTC to send files. This requires that the uploader leave their browser window open until the transfer is complete.

**Can multiple people download my file at once?** Yes! Just send them your short or long URL.

**How big can my files be?** As big as your browser can handle.

**What happens when I close my browser?** The URLs for your files will no longer work. If a downloader has completed the transfer, that downloader will continue to seed to incomplete downloaders, but no new downloads may be initiated.

**Are my files encrypted?** Yes, all WebRTC communications are automatically encrypted using public-key cryptography because of DTLS. You can add an optional password to your upload for an extra layer of security.
